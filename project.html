There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the current market.</br></br> As we studied earlier, 'C' is a base language for many programming languages.

             <h2>What is c++ language?</h2>
             <p>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.</p>
         </div>
		 <div class="column">
             <h2>What is?</h2>
             <p>C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes." However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>

             <p>C++ is one of the most popular languages primarily utilized with system/application software, drivers, client-server applications and embedded firmware.The main highlight of C++ is a collection of predefined classes, which are data types that can be instantiated multiple times. The language also facilitates declaration of user-defined classes. Classes can further accommodate member functions to implement specific functionality.</p>

             <h2>What is Python?</h2>
             <p>Python is a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and simple to implement. It is open source, which means it is free to use, even for commercial applications. Python can run on Mac, Windows, and Unix systems and has also been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines.</p>
         </div>
		 <div class="column">
             <h2>What is?</h2>
             <p>Python can be used as the script in Microsoft's Active Server Page (ASP) technology. The scoreboard system for the Melbourne (Australia) Cricket Ground is written in Python. Z Object Publishing Environment, a popular Web application server, is also written in the Python language.</p>

             <h2>Techopedia explains Python Programming Language</h2>
             <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>

             <h2>What is Java?</h2>
             <p>Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed for developing programs for set-top boxes and handheld devices, but later became a popular choice for creating web applications.</p>
         </div>
		 <div class="column">
             <h2>What is?</h2>
             <p>The Java syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly an object-oriented programming language. For example, most Java programs contain classes, which are used to define objects, and methods, which are assigned to individual classes. Java is also known for being more strict than C++, meaning variables and functions must be explicitly defined. This means Java source code may produce errors or "exceptions" more easily than other languages, but it also limits other types of errors that may be caused by undefined variables or unassigned types.</p>

             <h2>Techopedia explains Java Programming Language</h2>
             <p> Java produces applets (browser-run programs), which facilitate graphical user interface (GUI) and object interaction by Internet users. Prior to Java applets, Web pages were typically static and non-interactive. </br></br>Java applets have diminished in popularity with the release of competing products, such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight. Java program development requires a Java software development kit (SDK) that typically includes a compiler, interpreter, documentation generator and other tools used to produce a complete application.</p>

             <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
             <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.</p>
         </div>
		 <div class="column">
             <h2>What is?</h2>
             <p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</p>

		 <div class="column">
             <h2>Techopedia explains Javascript Programming Language</h2>
             <p> Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser. </p>
